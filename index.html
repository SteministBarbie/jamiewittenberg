        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          I used to be a high school math teacher; I made the transition to tech working with The Flatiron School, Wyncode Academy, and Codecademy. I spent nearly two years at Major League Hacking, perfecting the learning experience for the hacker community. With nearly a
          decade of teaching experience and close to five in tech, I have learned how to translate understanding the needs of a heterogenous group of students into painstaking empathy for my users.
        </p>
        <p>Now, I work at Oscar Health as the Product Manager for Oscar for Business, making it possible for small groups in several states to offer Oscar Health insurance to their employees.</p>

        <h2>Areas of Focus</h2>
        <h3>The Emergent Developer</h3>
        <p>
          The focus of my career over the last several years has endowed me with a particular expertise in the emergent developer. Technical skills are only one part of the equation; problem-solving, interviewing skills, networking, and personal
          branding are critical to matching early-career engineers with the right job.
        </p>
        <h3>Diversity and Inclusion</h3>
        <p>
          D&amp;I isn't just about getting more women or more people of color or more neurodiverse or more non-traditional engineers at the stand-up; it's about making them comfortable, valued, and included &mdash; from day one.
        </p>
        <h3>Technical Education Pedagogy</h3>
        <p>
          In teaching and learning, there's the <em>what</em> and there's the <em>how</em>. I spend a lot of time exploring the ways in which the what informs the how and bringing that intersection to life for anyone who wants to learn new technical
          skills.
